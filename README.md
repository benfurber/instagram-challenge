We were given a couple of days to build Instagram using Rails. This was going to require at least three models; users, posts and comments.

I started with the users model by installing and setting up the Devise gem. This then lead to quite a while getting the tests to pass.

Next was posts, generated with scaffold for a full RESTful mode and more editing of the generated tests. Linking the two models was relatively straightforward with extra work in controllers.

Comments. Done too, though only just - and with poor test coverage.
